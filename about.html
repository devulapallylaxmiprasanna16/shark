      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>About Sharks from Space

Sharks from Space is a project created for NASA’s 2025 Space Apps Challenge. It uses NASA’s satellite data to track and study shark movements and habitats. The project analyzes ocean data, like currents and temperature, to predict where sharks forage, helping with marine conservation. Developed for a global NASA hackathon, it shows how space technology can protect ocean ecosystems. By using NASA’s data, Sharks from Space supports shark research and ocean biodiversity preservation.</p>
